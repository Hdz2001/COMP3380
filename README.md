Instructions to run the project: 
1. Login to uranium and run the Project.sql in the server to populate the database with datas.
2. Edit the auth.cfg with your username and password that you used to login to uranium.
* To save time, you can enter the following infos into auth.cfg:
  * username=trannh
  * password=7876849
* This will bring you to my personal's uranium server, where all the data is already populated w/o errors and thus, you can skip step 1.
4. Enter "make" in the command prompt to build the program.
5. Enter "make run" after to run the program.
* make clean is also included to clean up everything.  
5. Follow instructions in the program. Enjoy :)
